A silly demo in Applesoft BASIC

To run it, put the text file on an Apple disk (or disk image for emulators).
Then boot into BASIC and type "exec demo.txt" to load the program into
the BASIC interpreter.  Then you should be able to "run" the program. 

If you want to skip that step in the future, you can "save" it to disk like
a normal basic program.
